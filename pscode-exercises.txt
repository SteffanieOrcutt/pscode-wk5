Print average "is the average of your numbers" 
If number1 < number2 and number3 and number4 and number5
	Print number1 "is the smallest number in your set"
	else If number2 < number3 and number4 and number5 and number1
	Print number2 "is the smallest number in your set"
	else If number3 < number4 and number5 and number1 and number2
	Print number3 "is the smallest number in your set"
	else If number4 < number5 and number1 and number2 and number3
	Print number1 "is the smallest number in your set"
	else If number5 < number3 and number4 and number5 and number1
	Print number5 "is the smallest number in your set"
If number1 > number2 and number3 and number4 and number5
	Print number1 "is the largest number in your set"
	else If number2 > number3 and number4 and number5 and number1
	Print number2 "is the largest number in your set"
	else If number3 > number4 and number5 and number1 and number2
	Print number3 "is the largest number in your set"
	else If number4 > number5 and number1 and number2 and number3
	Print number1 "is the largest number in your set"
	else If number5 > number3 and number4 and number5 and number1
	Print number5 "is the largest number in your set"
